Checkpoint 1:

Bug:
Always getting a general protection fault and if while(1) if removed from handler we get it over and over again.
Solution:
PIT was enabled. Disabled all interrupts until their specific set up to prevent this.

Checkpoint 2:

Bug: RTC_WRITE seemed to break RTC Interrupts
Solution:
had sti() and cli() in the wrong order lol

Bug: RTC changed speeds incorrectly
Solution:
Higher Rate = lower Frequency apparently

Bug: Caps and shift never turn off
Solution:
Needed to put release shift scancode handler and caps lock bug was cause because I(Sam) remapped my caps lock key to give my windows keyboard a CMD button for my Mac because my onboard keyboard and trackpad broke for no reason. 


Checkpoint 3:

Bug:  Target Remote does not work
Solution:
Hershel needs to open test_debug

Bug: IRET Appeared to Segfault
Solution: 
Error was actually in sys_calls (not initializing fd_array).

Bug: paging had issues initializing
Solution:
Changed the "i" to a "j" (the for loop specified i, but j was used in the loop variables...).

Bug: Constant Variables were not working properly in sys_calls_link.S
Solution:
Declare equivalent local versions of the variables and call those instead.
