Checkpoint 1:

Bug:
Always getting a general protection fault and if while(1) if removed from handler we get it over and over again.
Person: Jonathan
Solution:
PIT was enabled. Disabled all interrupts until their specific set up to prevent this.

Checkpoint 2:

Bug: RTC_WRITE seemed to break RTC Interrupts
Person: Jonathan
Solution:
had sti() and cli() in the wrong order lol

Bug: RTC changed speeds incorrectly
Person: Jonathan
Solution:
Higher Rate = lower Frequency apparently

Bug: Caps and shift never turn off
Person: Sam
Solution:
Needed to put release shift scancode handler and caps lock bug was cause because I(Sam) remapped my caps lock key to give my windows keyboard a CMD button for my Mac because my onboard keyboard and trackpad broke for no reason. 


Checkpoint 3:

Bug:  Target Remote does not work
Person: Hershel
Solution:
Hershel needs to open test_debug

Bug: IRET Appeared to Segfault
Person: Sam
Solution: 
Error was actually in sys_calls (not initializing fd_array).

Bug: paging had issues initializing
Person: Austin
Solution:
Changed the "i" to a "j" (the for loop specified i, but j was used in the loop variables...).

Bug: Constant Variables were not working properly in sys_calls_link.S
Person: Sam
Solution:
Declare equivalent local versions of the variables and call those instead.

Bug: Persistant Page Fault in Halt
Person: Sam, Hershel, Jonathan
Solution: 
Logic for restoring the esp and ebp for the parent was wrong. Were restoring from the parent
pcb but that info is stored in the current pcb. Changing that allowed us to halt successfully
Time Spent: 3.75 weeks

Checkpoint 4:

Bug: Page Fault in vidmap
Person: Jonathan and Austin
Solution:
Turns out that the paging table set up funtion only takes in incrememnts of full MB but the video 
memory (0xB8000) is not aligned to a full MB. The solution we decided on was to map the new page to 
0 instead of xB8000 but set the screen start pointed to B8000 + new page location.
This works since video memory is not close to 4MB in size. 

Bug: All reads going to terminal read
Person: Sam
Solution:
Sys_open always returned 0 instead of the fd
