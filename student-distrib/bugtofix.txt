Why is the keyboard handler set to user level access in idt_init?


What: exec.file_name in execute is cmd arg + a bunch of junk values. But we don’t use it after that for now…

TO DO: 
Multiple terminals:
-store currently running process information in its base shell's pcb (OR DEDICATED PAGE).
-change attribute byte of text based on which terminal the process is running in
-store base shell pcb pointer in all of its child processes
-context switches to different terminal (may be in user mode or kernel mode)
-video memory manipulation when terminal switches
	- decide what strategy to use
	
What: read_data in filesystem when given length = 0 reads the 0th byte of the file
